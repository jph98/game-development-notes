#3. First Creation

https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-create-pixel-art-for-your-game/learn/v4/lecture/4186300

* Use blocks to define the main shapes (big boxes)
* Treat it like a sculpture, shave bits off it
* Define your colour palette using several appropriate colours
* Colour in
* Define a light source
* Define a darker set of colours for the palette
* Shade the parts you'd exepct to hit the light source
* Make sure you use zoom out to find out how your character looks

#4. Pixel Tools

# 5. Shapes, Values and Edges

Curves can be created through a basic one, two three pixels in an arc technique.

# 6. Negative Space

Incredibly important when using a reference image (look at the area around it).

# 7. Perspective

Draw smaller tree above and to the right of the other... 

# 8. Values

Choose a values palette.

Using values to show light based on a light source.

Using values to show depth.
* Contrast - at front (blacks, whites)
* * Reduce contrast as you go back in the image

Cleaning up your lines
* Fib Sequence for lines
 
Anti Aliasing
* Use conservatively

# 9. The Colour Wheel
* Choose five colours using the hue
* Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple

Warm and Cool
* Red, Orange, Yellow - Warm Colours (Light) WARM
* Green, Blue, Purple (Shadows) COOL

Primary - Red, Yellow, Blue
Secondary - Purple, Orange, Green
Tertiary - mix primary and secondary (Green + Blue = Teal)

Complimentary
* Yellow and Purple (opposite each other in the colour wheel, go together)
* Green and Orange
* Blue and Orange (best) - sunset

# 10. Hue
* Values from 0 - 255
* HSV
* Use this to create colours (HSV)

Saturation
* How grey or coloured this looks

Value with Colours
* (the V is HSV)
* Bright Blue vs Dark Blue
* More shadowed areas - shift V downwards

Creating a simple palette
* Fill the tree in green
* Bring the value (V) up for the green for the lighter parts
* Add saturation - going to be a bit more colourful
* Hue shifts need to be very subtle - value, some sat, move into blue

# 11. Mockup Shapes

https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-create-pixel-art-for-your-game/learn/v4/t/lecture/4228958

Step 1. Blocks and use the layers
Step 2. Greys - the values
Step 3. Then add the colours

# 12. Animation
* Toggle Onionskin
* Turn off animation by reducing frames to 0
* Coin Example - flipping the image and reducing the size

Key Frames - core to the animation
* Have additional frames as well, but not key to the main purpose
* Follow the key frames from the character sprite
